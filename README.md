# SHAP-Analysis-of-California-Housing-Prices-with-XGBoost
This project uses the California Housing dataset to train an XGBoost regression model and employs SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretability. It includes data loading, model training, and visualization of SHAP values via force plots, waterfalls, beeswarms, bars, and heatmaps.
